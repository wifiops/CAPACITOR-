# 🚀 QUICK START - Website Won't Load Fix

## The Problem
We migrated from vanilla HTML/JS to Next.js/React. The old files are gone, and you need to set up Next.js.

## Solution (2 Steps):

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## If npm install fails:
Make sure you have Node.js installed:
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- Install Node.js 18+ (LTS version)

## If you see errors:
- Make sure you're in the project directory: `C:\Users\wifix\Desktop\hewhomustbecompleted`
- Run commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt

---

**The website will work at http://localhost:3000 after running these commands!**
